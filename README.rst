flask_platform Repository
========================

This simple test project demonstrates the use of imported packages with a 
basic 'hello world' flask application. 
When the app is run, a method from the systeminfo package is imported and
used to print a greeting and platform specifications to a simple 
locally-hosted browser page.

The project is installable using pip, by typing the following into a 
command line:

	pip install git+https://github.com/MartinC20xx/flask_platform.git

For instructions on how to run the app from the command line, consult 
the following section of the Flask documentation:
